/**
 * A {@link Session} is an abstraction of a SQL database and
 * a group of {@link Operation}s to be executed by that SQL database. No method
 * on {@link Session} or any of its dependent objects ({@link RowOperation}
 * etc) blocks. Any method that might block must execute any potentially blocking
 * action in a thread other than the calling thread.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A {@link Session} is independent of any particular data source. Any data 
 * source that meets the specifications set by the {@link Builder} can
 * be used to execute the {@link Operation}s submitted to the {@link Session}.
 * An application is expected to create, use, and close {@link Session}s as 
 * needed. An application should hold a {@link Session} only when required by
 * data source semantics. An implementation should cache and reused data source
 * resources as appropriate. {@link Session}s should not be cached.
 *
 * <p>
 * An implementation of this type must be thread safe as result and error
 * handlers running asynchronously may be accessing a {@link Session} in
 * parallel with each other and with a user thread. {@link Session}s are not
 * required to support multiplexed use; a single {@link Session} should be
 * used for only one unit of work at a time. Executing independent units of work
 * on a single {@link Session} in parallel will most likely lead to
 * unpredictable outcomes. As a rule of thumb only one user thread should access
 * a {@link Session} at a time. Such a user thread should execute a complete
 * unit of work before another user thread accesses the {@link Session}. An
 * implementation may support parallel multiplexed use, but it is not required.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * All methods inherited from OperationGroup throw IllegalStateException if the
 * the {@link Session} is not active.</p>
